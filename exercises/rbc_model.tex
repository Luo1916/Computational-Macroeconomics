\section[RBC model]{RBC model\label{ex:RBCModel}}
Consider the basic Real Business Cycle (RBC) model with leisure.

\paragraph{Households}
The representative household maximizes present as well as expected future utility
\begin{align*}
\max \mathbb{E}_{t} \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \beta^{j} U_{t+j}
\end{align*}
with \(\beta <1\) denoting the discount factor and \(\mathbb{E}_{t}\) is expectation given information at time \(t\).
Note that \(t\) is the \emph{calendar time} for the economy,
  while \(t+j\) is the \emph{planning time} or \emph{horizon} of the household.
The contemporaneous utility function
\begin{align*}
U_t = \gamma \log(c_t) + \psi \log{l_t}
\end{align*}
is additively separable and has two arguments: consumption \(c_t\) and time devoted to leisure \(l_{t}\).
The marginal utility of both consumption and leisure is positive.
Accordingly, \(\gamma \) is the consumption weight in the utility function
  and \(\psi \) the weight on leisure.
In each period the household takes the real wage \(w_t\) as given
  and supplies perfectly elastic labor service \(n_t\) to the representative firm.
In return, she receives real labor income in the amount of \(w_t n_{t}\) and, additionally,
  real profits \({div}_t\) from the firm as well as
  revenue from lending capital \(k_{t-1}\) at real rental rate \(r^{k}_{t}\) to the firms,
  as it is assumed that the firm and capital stock are owned by the household.
Income and wealth are used to finance consumption \(c_t\) and investment \(i_t\).
In total, this defines the (real) budget constraint of the household:
\begin{align*}
c_t + i_t = w_t n_{t} + r^{k}_{t} k_{t-1} + {div}_t
\end{align*}
The law of motion for capital \(k_t\) at the end of period \(t\) is given by
\begin{align*}
k_{t} = (1-\delta) k_{t-1} + i_t
\end{align*}
where \(\delta \) is the capital depreciation rate.\footnote{%
  Note that we use the end-of-period timing convention for capital, i.e.\
    \(k_t\) instead of \(k_{t+1}\),
    because the investment decision is done in period \(t\) and hence capital is also determined in \(t\).
  In older papers and books you will often find beginning-of-period timing convention for capital,
    so always think about when a variable is decided and determined.
}
  
\paragraph{Firms}
Productivity \(a_t\) is the driving force of the economy and evolves according to
\begin{align*}
\log{a_{t}} &= \rho_a \log{a_{t-1}}  + \varepsilon_{a,t}
\end{align*}
where \(\rho_a\) denotes the persistence parameter
and \(\varepsilon_{a,t}\) is assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and variance \(\sigma_a^2\).
	
Real profits \({div}_t\) of the representative firm are revenues from selling output \(y_t\)
  minus costs from labor \(w_t n^{d}_{t}\) and renting capital \(r^{k}_{t} k^{d}_{t-1}\):
\begin{align*}
{div}_t = y_{t} - w_{t} n^{d}_{t} - r^{k}_{t} k^{d}_{t-1}
\end{align*}
The representative firm maximizes expected profits
\begin{align*}
\max \mathbb{E}_{t} \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \mathcal{M}_{t,t+j}~{div}_{t+j}
\end{align*}
subject to a constant return to scale Cobb-Douglas production function
\begin{align*}
f(k^{d}_{t-1}, l^{d}_{t}) = y_t = a_t {(k^{d}_{t-1})}^\alpha {(n^{d}_{t})}^{1-\alpha}
\end{align*}
The stochastic discount factor \(\mathcal{M}_{t,t+j}\) takes into account that firms are owned by the household,
  i.e.\ it is the present value of a unit of consumption in period \(t+j\) or, respectively,
  the marginal utility of an additional unit of profit in the household's budget constraint:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{M}_{t,t+j} = \beta^j \frac{\partial U_{t+j}/\partial c_{t+j}}{\partial U_{t}/\partial c_{t}}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Constraints and normalizations}
The time budget for work and leisure is normalized to one:
\begin{align*}
l_t + n_t = 1
\end{align*}
Therefore, we have the following non-negativity constraints
  \(k_{t},k^{d}_{t} \geq 0\), \(c_{t} \geq 0\) and \(0 \leq l_{t},n_{t},n^{d}_{t} \leq 1\).
Lastly, we assume that the transversality condition,
  \(\mathbb{E}_{t} [\lim_{j\rightarrow \infty} \mathcal{M}_{t,t+j} k_{t+j}]=0\),
  is full-filled.

\paragraph{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Show that the first-order conditions of the representative household are given by
\begin{equation*}
(i)~U_{c,t} = \beta \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[U_{c,t+1} \left(1-\delta + r^{k}_{t+1}\right)\right] \qquad \text{and} \qquad
(ii)~w_t = -\frac{U_{n,t}}{U_{c,t}}
\end{equation*}
where \(U_{c,t} = \gamma c_t^{-1}\) and \(U_{n,t} = \frac{-\psi}{1-n_t}\).
Interpret these equations in economic terms.

\item
Show that the first-order conditions of the representative firm are given by
\begin{equation*}
(iii)~w_t = f_n \qquad \text{and} \qquad
(iv)~r^{k}_{t} = f_k
\end{equation*}
where \(f_n = (1-\alpha) a_t {\left(\frac{k^{d}_{t-1}}{n^{d}_{t}}\right)}^{\alpha}\)
and \(f_k = \alpha a_t {\left(\frac{k^{d}_{t-1}}{n^{d}_{t}}\right)}^{\alpha-1}\).
Interpret these equations in economic terms.

\item
Show that combining the optimal decisions with clearing of both the labor market, i.e.\
  \(n_t = n^{d}_{t}\), and the capital market, \(k_{t} = k^{d}_{t}\) implies clearing of the goods market:
\begin{align*}
y_t = c_t + i_t
\end{align*}

\item
Derive with pen and paper the steady-state of the model,
  in the sense that there is a set of values for the endogenous variables
  that in equilibrium remain constant over time.

\item
Discuss how to calibrate the following parameters \(\alpha \), \(\beta \), \(\delta \), \(\gamma \), \(\psi \), \(\rho_a \) and \(\sigma_a \).

\item
Provide intuition behind the transversality condition.

\item
Write a MATLAB script that computes the steady-state of this RBC model
  with a feasible calibration for an OECD country.

\item
Write a Dynare mod file that computes the steady-state of this RBC model
  with a feasible calibration for an OECD country by using a \texttt{steady\_state\_model} block.
Compare this to the steady-state computed with MATLAB above.

\item
Now assume a contemporaneous utility function of the CRRA (constant Relative Risk Aversion) type:\footnote{%
  Note that due to L'Hopital's rule \(\eta_c=\eta_l=1\) implies the original specification,
  \(U_t=\gamma \log c_t + \psi \log(l_t)\).
}
\begin{align*}
  U_t = \gamma \frac{c_{t}^{1-\eta_c}-1}{1-\eta_c} + \psi \frac{l_{t}^{1-\eta_l}-1}{1-\eta_l}
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Derive the model equations and steady-state analytically.
  \item
  Write a MATLAB script to compute the steady-state for the RBC model with CRRA utility.
  \item
  Write a Dynare mod file and compute the steady-state for the RBC model with CRRA utility
    by using a helper function in the \texttt{steady\_state\_model} block.
