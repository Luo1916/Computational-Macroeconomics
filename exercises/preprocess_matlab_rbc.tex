\section[RBC model: preprocessing in MATLAB]{RBC model: preprocessing in MATLAB\label{ex:PreprocessMATLABRBC}}
Consider the basic Real Business Cycle (RBC) model with leisure and log utility function.
The dynamic model equations are given in Table~\ref{tbl:RBC.Model},
  the variable description in Table~\ref{tbl:RBC.Variables},
  and the description and calibration of parameters in Table~\ref{tbl:RBC.Parameters}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Create a Dynare mod file for this model and compute the steady-state.

\item
Notice that Dynare's preprocessor creates a folder with a + and the name of your mod file.
Inside the folder you can find different files.
Briefly explain what the script files \texttt{driver.m},
  \texttt{dynamic\_resid.m}, \texttt{dynamic\_g1.m},
  \texttt{static\_resid.m} and \texttt{static\_g1.m} do.

\item
Briefly explain Dynare's \texttt{M\_.lead\_lag\_incidence} matrix.

\item
Use MATLAB's Symbolic Math Toolbox to process the same model without Dynare.
To this end:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item
  Create the string arrays
  \texttt{endo\_names}, \texttt{exo\_names} and \texttt{param\_names}
  that contain the names of the endogenous and exogenous variables
    as well as the parameters.
  
  \item
  Store the length of the vectors to variables called
    \texttt{endo\_names\_nbr}, \texttt{exo\_names\_nbr}, and \texttt{param\_names\_nbr}.

  \item
  Create symbolic variables in the workspace with a
    \texttt{\_back}, \texttt{\_curr}, \texttt{\_fwrd}, and \texttt{\_stst} suffix,
	using the names in \texttt{endo\_names} and the \texttt{syms} command.
  That is, \texttt{a\_back} should be a symbolic variable denoting \(a_{t-1}\),
	\texttt{a\_curr} should be a symbolic variable denoting \(a_{t}\),
	\texttt{a\_fwrd} should be a symbolic variable denoting \(a_{t+1}\),
	and \texttt{a\_stst} should be a symbolic variable denoting the steady-state \(a\).

  \item
  Create symbolic variables using the names in \texttt{exo\_names} and the \texttt{syms} command.

  \item
  Create symbolic variables using the names in \texttt{param\_names} and the \texttt{syms} command.

  \item
  Create a symbolic vector \texttt{dynamic\_eqs}
    with the dynamic model equations given in Table~\ref{tbl:RBC.Model}
	(put everything on the left-hand side).
  Use the just declared convention for symbolic variables and parameters.

  \item
  Create the \texttt{lead\_lag\_incidence} matrix and use it to distinguish the following types of variables:
  \begin{itemize}
	\item static variables, which appear only at \(t\), but neither at \(t-1\) nor at \(t+1\).
	\item predetermined variables, which appear only at \(t-1\), possibly at \(t\), but not at \(t+1\).
	\item forward variables, which appear only at \(t+1\), possibly at \(t\), but not at \(t-1\).
	\item mixed variables, which appear at \(t-1\) and \(t+1\), and possibly at \(t\).
	\item dynamic variables, which actually appear in the dynamic model equations
	\item exogenous variables
  \end{itemize}

  \item
  Compute the Jacobian of \texttt{dynamic\_eqs}
    with respect to symbolic dynamic variables and the symbolic exogenous variables.

  \item
  Compute the static model equations using the \texttt{subs} command
    to substitute the dynamic variables with their corresponding name
	without the \texttt{\_back}, \texttt{\_curr}, or \texttt{\_fwrd} suffix.
  Store the static model equations in the symbolic variable \texttt{static\_eqs}.

  \item
  Compute the Jacobian of \texttt{static\_eqs} with respect to symbolic endogenous variables.

  \item
  Write out the static and dynamic model equations and Jacobians to script files:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor,basicstyle=\mlttfamily\scriptsize]
writeOut(static_eqs,'rbc_static_resid','residual',1,dynamic_names,endo_names,exo_names,param_names);
writeOut(static_g1,'rbc_static_g1','g1',1,dynamic_names,endo_names,exo_names,param_names);
writeOut(dynamic_eqs,'rbc_dynamic_resid','residual',0,dynamic_names,endo_names,exo_names,param_names);
writeOut(dynamic_g1,'rbc_dynamic_g1','g1',0,dynamic_names,endo_names,exo_names,param_names);
\end{lstlisting}
  The function \texttt{writeOut.m} is given in Appendix~\ref{app:writeOut}.

  \item
  Make the whole script a function called \texttt{preprocessingRBC.m}
    with an output variable MODEL,
	which is a structure containing information on the names
	and numbers of the endogenous and exogenous variables,
	the names and numbers of the parameters,
	and also the \texttt{lead\_lag\_incidence} matrix.

\end{enumerate}

\item Compare Dynare's preprocessing and the manual preprocessing done in MATLAB.\@
To this end:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Run dynare on the mod file to create the preprocessing files
	and to compute the steady-state.
  Append the following code at the end of your mod file:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor,basicstyle=\mlttfamily\scriptsize]
% create steady-state vectors
[I,~] = find(M_.lead_lag_incidence');
y_ss   = oo_.steady_state;      % steady-state of endogenous variables
zzz_ss = oo_.steady_state(I);   % steady-state of dynamic variables
ex_ss  = oo_.exo_steady_state'; % steady-state of exogenous variables

% evaluate dynamic model residuals and Jacobian at steady-state
[dynare_resid, dynare_g1] = feval([M_.fname,'.dynamic'], zzz_ss, ex_ss, M_.params, y_ss, 1);
% evaluate static model residuals and Jacobian at steady-state
[dynare_resid_static, dynare_g1_static] = feval([M_.fname,'.static'], y_ss, ex_ss, M_.params);
\end{lstlisting}

  \item
  Preprocess the model with MATLAB and evaluate the script files at the steady-state:

  \item
  Look at the differences of the computed residuals
    and Jacobians of both dynamic and static model equations
	between Dynare's and MATLAB's preprocessing.

\end{enumerate}
