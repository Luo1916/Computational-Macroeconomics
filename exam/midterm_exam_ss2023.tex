\section[Monopolistic competition and irreversible investments]{Monopolistic competition and irreversible investments\label{ex:RBCModelMonCompIrrInvest}}

\begin{center} \Large \textbf{Model Description} \end{center}

\paragraph{Households: Utility}
The economy is assumed to be inhabited by a representative family with identical members.
The household's preferences are defined over consumption \(c_t\) and labor effort \(h_t\).
The representative household maximizes present as well as expected future utility
\begin{align}
\max E_t \sum_{s=0}^{\infty} \beta^{s} \left( \frac{c_{t+s}^{1-\sigma_c}}{1-\sigma_c} - \chi_h \frac{h_{t+s}^{1+\sigma_h}}{1+\sigma_h} \right)\label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.UtilityLifetime}
\end{align}
where \(E_t\) is the expectation operator conditional on information at time \(t\),
  \(\beta <1\) denotes the discount factor,
  \(\sigma_c\) and \(\sigma_h\) are elasticities and \(\chi_h\) the consumption weight.

\paragraph{Households: Capital Accumulation}
The household owns the (end of period) capital stock \(k_t\) which evolves according to
\begin{align}
k_t = (1-\delta)k_{t-1} + i_t \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.CapitalAccumulation}
\end{align}
where \(\delta \) is the depreciation rate.

\paragraph{Households: Irreversible Investment}
An occasionally binding constraint is imposed that prevents investment \(i_t\) from falling below a fraction \(\omega \)
  of its value in the non-stochastic steady-state (denoted by \(i\)):
\begin{align}
i_t \geq \omega \cdot i \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.IrrInvest}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Households: Budget}
Capital is rented to the intermediate firms at a nominal rate of \(R^k_{t}\) which the household takes as given when forming optimal plans.
Similarly, in each period the household takes the nominal wage \(W_t\) as given and supplies perfectly elastic labor service \(h_t\) to the firm sector.
In return she receives nominal labor income \(W_t h_t\).
All firms are owned by the household so that nominal profits and dividends from firms in the final good sector, \( Div^{Fin}_t\),
  as well as from each firm \(f\in[0,1]\) in the intermediate goods sector, \(\int_0^1 {Div}^{Int}_t(f)df\),
  are received by the household.
Income and wealth are used to finance consumption and investment expenditures, both are quoted at price level \(P_t\).
In total this defines the \emph{nominal} budget constraint of the household
\begin{align}
P_t c_t + P_t i_t =  W_t h_t + R^k_t k_{t-1} + Div^{Fin}_t + \int_0^1 Div^{Int}_t(f) df \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.BudgetNominal}
\end{align}
In what follows, let lower case letters denote real variables, i.e.\
\begin{align*}
w_t = \frac{W_t}{P_t},\quad
r^k_t = \frac{R^k_t}{P_t},\quad
div^{Fin}_t = \frac{Div^{Fin}_t}{P_t},\quad
div^{Int}_t = \frac{Div^{Int}_t}{P_t}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Final Good Firm (Retail Sector): Profit Maximization}
The economy is populated by a continuum of firms indexed by \(f \in [0,1]\) that produce differentiated goods \(y_t(f)\) in monopolistic competition.
The technology for transforming these intermediate goods into the final output good \(y_t\) that can be used for consumption and investment is given by:
\begin{align}
y_t = {\left[\int\limits_0^1 {(y_t(f))}^{\frac{\nu_t-1}{\nu_t}}df\right]}^{\frac{\nu_t}{\nu_t-1}} \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.Firms.Aggregator}
\end{align}
where \(\nu_t\) is the time-varying elasticity of substitution between differentiated goods.

\paragraph{Intermediate Goods Firms (Wholesale Sector): Profit Maximization}
Intermediate firm \(f\in[0,1]\) uses the following production function to produce their differentiated good
\begin{align}
y_t(f) = a_t {(k_{t-1}(f))}^\alpha {(n_t(f))}^{1-\alpha} \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.IntermediateFirms.ProductionFunction}
\end{align}
where \(a_t\) denotes the common technology level available to all firms.
Firms face perfectly competitive factor markets for renting capital \(k_{t-1}(f)\) and hiring labor \(n_t(f)\) with \(\alpha \) being a productivity parameter.
Nominal profits of firm \(f\) are equal to revenues from selling its differentiated good at self-determined price \(P_t(f)\)
  minus costs from hiring labor at real wage \(w_t\) and real renting rate of capital \(r^k_t\):
\begin{align}
{Div}^{Int}_t(f) = P_t(f) y_t(f) - P_t w_t n_t(f) - P_t r^k_t k_{t-1}(f) \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.Firms.Profits}
\end{align}
The objective of the firm is to choose contingent plans for \(P_t(f)\), \(n_t(f)\) and \(k_{t-1}(f)\)
  so as to maximize the present discounted value of nominal dividend payments given by
\begin{align*}
E_t \sum_{s=0}^{\infty} \beta^s \frac{\lambda_{t+s+1}}{\lambda_{t+s}} Div^{Int}_{t+s}(f)
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Exogenous Variables}
The level of technology \(a_t\) and the elasticity \(\nu_t\) evolve according to
\begin{align}
\log{a_t} &= \rho_a \log{a_{t-1}} + \varepsilon_{a,t} \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.LoM.TFP}
\\
\nu_t &= \bar{\nu} + \varepsilon_{\nu,t} \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.LoM.Elast}
\end{align}
with persistence parameter \(\rho_a\) and target value \(\bar{\nu}>1\).
\(\varepsilon_{a,t}\) and \(\varepsilon_{\nu,t}\) are the exogenous variables.

\paragraph{Calibration}
Use the following values for the model parameters:
\begin{align*}
\beta = 0.96,
\sigma_c = 2,
\sigma_h = 2,
\delta = 0.1,
\chi_h = 1.6, 
\alpha = 0.35,
\rho_a = 0.9,
\bar{\nu} = 5,
\omega = 0.975
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Hints}

\begin{itemize}
\item
A version of the model consists of 11 model equations which are given in
{\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.CapitalAccumulation}},
{\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.LoM.TFP}},
{\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.LoM.Elast}},
{\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.LaborSupply}},
{\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.EulerCapital}},
{\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.KuhnTuckerInvestment}},
{\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.RealMarginalCosts}},
{\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.MarginalCostsAggregated}},
{\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.IntermediateFirms.CapitalLaborRatioAggregated}},
{\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.AggregateDemand}}, and
{\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.AggregateSupply}}.

\item
Whenever creating plots, use a \emph{reasonable} time horizon
and scale to plot \(3 \times 3=9\) model variables (of your choice).

\item
In Dynare you can write the greater operand \(>\) and the less-or-equal operand \(<=\) just as you do in MATLAB:\\
\texttt{(i > OMEGA*steady{\_}state{(i)})} or \texttt{(i <= OMEGA*steady{\_}state{(i)})}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center} \Large \textbf{Exercises} \end{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Explain the economic intuition behind including irreversible investments in a DSGE model.

\item
Derive the intratemporal and intertemporal optimality conditions:
\begin{align}
w_t &= \chi_h h_t^{\sigma_h} c_t^{\sigma_c} \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.LaborSupply}
\\
c_t^{-\sigma_c} - \mu_t &= \beta E_t \left[ c_{t+1}^{-\sigma_c} \left( r^k_{t+1} + 1-\delta \right) - (1-\delta) \mu_{t+1}\right]
\label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.EulerCapital}
\end{align}
where \(\beta^s \mu_{t+s}\) is the Lagrange multiplier on the occasionally binding constraint~\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.IrrInvest} in period \(t+s\).
Note that the complementary slackness condition
\begin{align*}
\mu_t (i_t - \omega \cdot i) &= 0
\end{align*}
can be equivalently written as
\begin{align}
(i_t > \omega \cdot i) \cdot (\mu_t) &+ (i_t \leq \omega \cdot i) \cdot (i_t - \omega \cdot i) = 0  \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.KuhnTuckerInvestment}
\end{align}
Interpret these equations.

\item
Show that profit maximization in the final goods sector implies:
\begin{align}
y_t(f) &= {\left(\frac{P_t(f)}{P_t}\right)}^{-\nu_t} y_t \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.Firms.Demand}
\\
P_t y_t &= \int_{0}^{1} P_t(f) y_t(f) df \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.Firms.ZeroProfit}
\end{align}
Interpret the equation.
What does this imply for real profits \(div_t^{Fin}\) in the final goods sector?

\item
Show that profit maximization in the intermediate good sector implies:
\begin{align}
r^k_t &= mc_t(f) \alpha a_t {\left( \frac{n_t(f)}{k_{t-1}(f)}\right)}^{1-\alpha}
\label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.IntermediateFirms.CapitalDemand}
\\
w_t &= mc_t(f) (1-\alpha) a_t {\left(\frac{n_t(f)}{k_{t-1}(f)}\right)}^{-\alpha}
\label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.IntermediateFirms.LaborDemand}
\\
P_t(f) &= \frac{\nu_t}{\nu_t - 1} P_t mc_t(f) \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.IntermediateFirms.Price}
\end{align}
where \(mc_t(f)\) is the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to constraint~\eqref{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.IntermediateFirms.ProductionFunction}.
Interpret the equations.

\item
Show that all intermediate firms choose the same capital to labor ratio in production and marginal costs are the same across firms:
\begin{align}
\left(\frac{k_{t-1}(f)}{n_t(f)}\right) &= \left(\frac{w_t}{1-\alpha}\right) \left(\frac{\alpha}{r^k_t}\right) \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.IntermediateFirms.CapitalLaborRatio}
\\
mc_t \equiv mc_t(f) &= \frac{1}{a_t} {\left(\frac{w_t}{1-\alpha}\right)}^{1-\alpha} {\left(\frac{r^k_t}{\alpha}\right)}^{\alpha} \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.RealMarginalCosts}
\end{align}

\item
Show that aggregation and market clearing implies:
\begin{align}
mc_t = \frac{\nu_t-1}{\nu_t} \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.MarginalCostsAggregated}
\\
\left(\frac{k_{t-1}}{h_t}\right) &= \left(\frac{w_t}{1-\alpha}\right) \left(\frac{\alpha}{r^k_t}\right) \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.IntermediateFirms.CapitalLaborRatioAggregated}
\\
\int_{0}^{1} div_t(f) df &= y_t - w_t h_t - r^k_t k_{t-1}\label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.IntermediateFirms.AggregateProfits}
\\
y_t &= c_t + i_t \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.AggregateDemand}
\\
y_t &= a_t k_{t-1}^\alpha h_t^{1-\alpha} \label{eq:RBCMonopIrrInv.AggregateSupply}
\end{align}
Interpret the equations.

\item

  in the sense that there is a set of values for the endogenous variables that in equilibrium remain constant over time.

\item Write a Dynare mod file that computes the steady-state of this model using an \texttt{initval} block.

\item
Use a perfect foresight simulation for computing the transition path
  for a permanent increase in the elasticity \(\nu_t\) from \(\bar{\nu}\) to \((\bar{\nu}+3)\).
