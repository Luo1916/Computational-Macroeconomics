While R is still a good choice, Julia is the language the authors now tend to pick for new projects and generally recommend.}

  abstract = {This paper describes the recent advances for rapidly and accurately solving matrix Riccati and Sylvester equations and applies them to devise efficient computational methods for solving and estimating dynamic linear economies. The chapter explores the most promising solution methods available and compares their speed and accuracy for some particular economic examples. Except for the simplest dynamic linear models, it is necessary to compute solutions numerically. In estimation contexts, computation speed is important because climbing a likelihood function can require that a model be solved many times. Methods that are faster than direct iterations on the Riccati equation and are more reliable than solutions based on eigenvalue--eigenvector decompositions of the state--costate evolution equation are discussed in the chapter. Two generalizations are presented in the chapter: The first generalization introduces forcing sequences or ``uncontrollable states'' into the deterministic regulator problem, while the second generalization introduces, among other things, discounting and uncertainty into the augmented regulator problem.},

These findings stem from important dynamic interactions of capital and labor absent in earlier equilibrium analyses of fiscal policy.}

Preferences and production possibilities are restricted so that the economy displays steady state growth. Then we explore the implications of the basic model for perfect foresight capital accumulation and for economic fluctuations initiated by impulses to technology. We argue that the neoclassical approach holds considerable promise for enhancing our understanding of fluctuations. Nevertheless, the basic model does have some important shortcomings. In particular, substantial persistence in technology shocks is required if the model economy is to exhibit periods of economic activity that persistently deviate from a deterministic trend.}

Our presentationof the basic neoclassical model of growth and business cycles is broken intothree parts. First, we describe the model and its steady state, discussing:the structure of the environment including government policy rules; the natureof optimal individual decisions and the dynamic competitive equilibrium;technical restrictions to insure steady state growth; comparable restrictionson preferences and policy rules; stationary levels and ratios in the steadystate; and the nature of a transformed economy. Second, we detail methods forstudying near steady-state dynamics, considering: the linear approximationapproach; the rational expectations solution algorithm; the nature ofalternative solutions; and the special case of the fixed labor model. Third,we discuss the computation of simulations, moments and impulse responses.The objective of this appendix is to provide a detailed analysis of aneoclassical economy that is sufficiently flexible to permit: (a) exogenoussteady state growth; (b) distorting tax rules of various sorts; and (c) timevarying government spending. Although we do not focus on all of these issuesin the present discussion, other investigations in progress will utilize thisframework. The appendix is divided into three main parts. Part A describes theartificial economy under study and analyses its steady state, Part B developsmethods to study approximate dynamics around the steady state, and Part Cderives a set of formulas for generating population moments. This technicalappendix is designed to serve two functions. First, it develops thetheoretical material in Sections 2 and 3 of the main text in more depths.Second, it serves as a detailed guide to PC-MATLAB programs for computingdynamic equilibria, written by King and Rebelo in the Spring of 1987. Notation in programs and the technical appendix has been detailed as closely as feasible.}

Yet, there is increasing skepticism that technology shocks are a major source of business fluctuations. This chapter exposits the basic RBC model and shows that it requires large technology shocks to produce realistic business cycles. While Solow residuals are sufficiently volatile, these imply frequent technological regress. Productivity studies permitting unobserved factor variation find much smaller technology shocks, suggesting the imminent demise of real business cycles. However, we show that greater factor variation also dramatically amplifies shocks: a RBC model with varying capital utilization yields realistic business cycles from small, nonnegative changes in technology.},

First, we describe the ingredients that help us to reduce the cost of global solution methods. These are efficient nonproduct techniques for interpolating and approximating functions (Smolyak, stochastic simulation, and -distinguishable set grids), accurate low-cost monomial integration formulas, derivative-free solvers, and numerically stable regression methods. Second, we discuss endogenous grid and envelope condition methods that reduce the cost and increase accuracy of value function iteration. Third, we show precomputation techniques that construct solution manifolds for some models' variables outside the main iterative cycle. Fourth, we review techniques that increase the accuracy of perturbation methods: a change of variables and a hybrid of local and global solutions. Finally, we show examples of parallel computation using multiple CPUs and GPUs including applications on a supercomputer. We illustrate the performance of the surveyed methods using a multiagent model. Many codes are publicly available.}
